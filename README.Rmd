### Retrieve area boundaries and data from the ONS Open Geography Portal

The main function of this package is to download area lookups and boundaries
  (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all sub-areas - at a
  specified level - within a specified area.
The main script will return a data frame with the sub-area geometry column,
  as an `sf` object ready to be visualised as a map.
It's initially just for areas within England and Wales, with a hope to add
  Scottish geographies at a later date.
And currently just for the following area levels:
  LSOA, MSOA, Ward, LAD/LTLA, UTLA/CTY, CAUTH, RGN _[subject to change]_


## Installation

```
remotes::install_github("francisbarton/jogger")
```

## Examples

```{r example-1, message = FALSE}
library(jogger)
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(tmap)

tmap::tmap_mode("plot")

geo_get("wd", "Swindon", "lad") %>% 
  tmap::tm_shape() +
  tmap::tm_borders()

```


```{r example-2}
geo_get("msoa", "Swansea", "lad", return_centroids = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)

```


```{r example-3}
geo_get("lsoa", "Zetland", "ward", shape_fields = TRUE)

```


```{r example-4}
geo_get(bounds_level = "lad",
  within = "Gloucestershire",
  within_level = "cty",
  return_style = "simple",
  return_boundaries = FALSE)

```

Return a bare API query ready to be run or checked externally:

```{r example-5}
build_api_query(
  # currently you just have to know which ref to use - see build_api_query.R
  ref = 4, 
  within_level = "cauth20nm",
  within = "Greater Manchester"
)

```
